# Hybrid-Lightweight-Cryptography-for-Data-Security
In this project, we proposed an improvement to an existing hybrid cryptography method by integrating dynamic RSA with the newly developed ASCON lightweight cryptography. This algorithm was implemented using Python and Python libraries. This work was presented in 5th International Conference on Communication, Computing & Industry 6.0 - 2024 (C2I6-2024) held on December 6-7 organized by CMRIT, Bangalore.
